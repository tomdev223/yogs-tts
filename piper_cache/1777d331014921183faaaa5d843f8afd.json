{"text":"Once you sign up, you will be automatically assigned to the free tier. To view your subscriptions, click on the profile picture in the upper right corner and select “Subscription”. We offer five public plans: Free, Starter, Creator, Independent Publisher, and Growing Business. In addition, we also offer a sixth option - Enterprise - tailored to the unique needs and usage of our clients. On the subscription page, each plan details its offerings. This includes information about the total monthly character allotment, the number of custom voices simultaneously, and the quality of audio provided. Please note that custom voices and cloned voices have different meanings. Custom voices are all voices that are not automatically included with the accounts; this includes cloned voices. Cloning is only available on the Starter tier and above. However, the free plan offers three custom voices that you can create using our Voice Design tool or that you can add from the Voice Library. You can upgrade your subscription at any time, and any unused quota from your last subscription will roll over to the new plan. However, please remember that unused quota does not roll over from month to month; it is an allocated amount for that month only. You can read more about it here. From the subscription page, you can also downgrade your subscription at any point in time if you would like. When downgrading, it won’t take effect until the current cycle ends, ensuring that you won’t lose any of the monthly quota before your month is up. When generating content on our paid plans, you get commercial rights to use that content. If you are on the free plan, you can use the content non-commercially with attribution. If you use a cloned voice, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate permission to use them commercially, even on a paid plan. Read more about the license in our Terms of Service and in our help center here. For more information on payment methods, please refer to the Help Center. Suggest edits"}
